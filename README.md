# Python-for-number-theory

This repository contains a series of introductory instructional python notebooks, for computational number theory.  It is designed to introduce the Python programming languages to students who have (1) never programmed before and (2) are studying number theory.  It accompanies the book [An Illustrated Theory of Numbers](http://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-105), by Martin H. Weissman](martyweissman.com).
Those who are teaching elementary number theory, with or without the book, may be interested in using the notebooks with students.  They proceed through standard programming concepts:  variables, types, simple data structures, loops, control statements, functions.  At the same time they implement important number theoretic algorithms such as the Euclidean algorithm, prime factorization and primality testing, various algorithms in modular arithmetic, etc.
